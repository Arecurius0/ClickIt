# SimplePickIt

Plugin for ExileApi https://github.com/Queuete/ExileApi

Auto clicker to loot (click) items on the ground which are not hidden by your Lootfilter. Pressing the Hotkey will loot the closest Item to your character, keeping the hotkey pressed will loop this behaviour with a slight delay in between.
Minimal configuration:

* `PickUpKey` -> Hotkey which starts the process.
* `WaitTimeInMs` -> The time which the program waits between clicks. A too low setting may cause getting kicked from the server due to "too many actions".
